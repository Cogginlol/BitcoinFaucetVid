# Should you make a bitcoin crypto faucet in 2023? (NO...)

Video Guide - [https://youtu.be/YW\_QWQDCF6c](https://youtu.be/YW_QWQDCF6c)

Hey everyone, it’s Dan from Sidehustle Reliance. I’m a big fan of using Cryptocurrency Faucets to make some easy income, but I’ve always wondered what if I made one myself. As well as I’ve been trying to explore new ways to make passive income. In this article, I will be making faucets and seeing if I can profit from them. Firstly I want to mention, that I am not a financial adviser this video is purely for entertainment purposes, please do your own research before buying anything. Anyways as I’ve been using a Crypto Faucet for years, how much money could you potentially make if you own one yourself? Let’s explore it

**Setting up the Faucet**

Firstly I followed a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1xoedunacQ) on how to get set up. I used 000webhostapp to host my faucet for free, as I didn’t want it linked to this website. I then completed the signup and got it all sorted. My site name was “[https://bitcoinfaucet22.000webhostapp.com/”](https://bitcoinfaucet22.000webhostapp.com/”). I did find that the installation of the faucet application was a tad complex. For someone with private experience in website creation, there was a lot of transferring files and setting up Config files.

**The Crypto Faucet Made by Myself**

I then continued with the tutorial and managed to get the Faucetpay API linked up with the site. I chose Faucetpay to host the transactions as it’s the most well-known and will save me time in the future when topping up if I continue to use the site. Another thing to note, is the character limit on the FaucetPay API. You can only have a URL with 36 characters, which can cause an issue. I actually had to make two sites, as the first URL was 37 characters. I then deposited 1,000 satoshis into my faucet. All these Satoshis were earned using the passive app [Surfe.be](https://Surfe.be).

**How does the Crypto Faucet make money?**

Now that the site is working, you may be wondering how will this make me money though. So when creating faucets, you can add links that can redirect from one site to another. The links can push traffic through certain providers which can pay you a small number of commissions using these platforms. The most common provider of this would be Adfly. But during the creation of this faucet, I decided, I’ll be using Owllink. I simply signed up with my email and installed the API sorted, and now I’ll be earning passively.

I initially set the satoshis which will be earned to 3 per hour. This is due to all the other faucets offering a similar amount. If the CPM rate of Owllink is 2$ per 1,000 I should make around $0.60 or a profit of $0.35 per 1,000 satoshis. The reason this is so low is that I’m wanting to test the market. I’ve never done this before, and I rather not put money into something rather new.

Now I’ve tested it out, it’s best to wait a week and I’ll show you how much I’ve made…

**8 month since I made my Crypto Faucet**

Sadly, due to using free hosting, I’ve had a few issues getting my faucet approved. When you’re going to make a faucet, Faucet Pay needs to approve that you’re suitable, but due to using free hosting, the site is so unreliable, meaning that I’m not listed on the affiliate list and making zero money in ad revenue.

**Final thoughts**

I would not recommend making a crypto faucet ever. You need a high starting cost for hosting fees to get a robust system, and the barrier to entry is way too high. It was a good experiment, and I learned a lot following this escapade.
